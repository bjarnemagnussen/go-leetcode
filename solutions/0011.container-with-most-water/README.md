# 11. Container With Most Water

Given n non-negative integers <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a_1, a_2, ..., a_n">, where each represents a point at coordinate <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(i, a_i)">. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line `i` is at <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(i, a_i)"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(i, 0)">. Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and `n` is at least 2.
